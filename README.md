# BubbleSort
Implementation of bubble sort algorithm on array of numerical values

## Why?
I wanted a better understanding of how bubble sort works

## Running the Script
No libraries or anything special needed, just run the script as is. The values to be sorted are hardcoded and can be modified if desired.
